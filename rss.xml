            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Updating LA's Historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</h1><p>On the roster of storied LA hotels, The Hollywood Roosevelt ranks high on the list, with its blend of Old Hollywood lore and allure.

It is on display at La Triennale in Milan, where innumerable furniture-makers showcase their work in an annual design fair. Sofas (and chairs, for that matter) at Salone del Mobile are like fish in an aquarium: plentiful and beautiful, but, after a while, hard to discern.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/878c309bc4bb2576485cf628acdf5521363f1166.jpg"></article>]]></description>
